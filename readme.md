## CNN Implementation Numpy

Includes:
* Implementation of CNN (consisting of maxpool, relu, fully-connected and convolutional layers) using Numpy Vectorisation (from scratch without any third-party library)
* Studying the effects of different hyperparameters using hyperparameter tuning in pytorch implementation of CNN:
    * learning rate (static or scheduled)
    * loss functions 
    * Number of epochs
    * Batch-sizes
    * Adam and SGD optimisers
* Achieving best accuracy on CIFAR-10 datasets using different techniques like Batch, Group Normalisations, Weight decays and Dropout layers

Use CIFAR-10 dataset from [this link](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
and refer to unpickling details for python given in the website.

Refer to `Report.pdf` for more implementation details and analysis part.
